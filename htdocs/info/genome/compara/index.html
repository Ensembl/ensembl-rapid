<h1>Comparative analyses</h1>

<h2>Homologues</h2>
    
<p>All rapid release species now have homologues with an appropriate set of reference species, allowing us to assign gene symbols where possible. In order to allow us to release this data in a timely manner across hundreds of species, we create one compara database per species, and these are periodically updated as new annotations become available for their references species.</p>

<h3>Reference genomes</h3>

<p>For each species, a set of references are drawn from the appropriate division (vertebrates, metazoa, plants, etc):</p>

<h2>Multiple alignments</h2>

<p>We are adding <a href="/info/data/ftp/index.html">HAL multiple alignments for selected clades</a>, available to download from our FTP site.</p>
