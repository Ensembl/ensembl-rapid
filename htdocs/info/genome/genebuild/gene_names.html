<h1>Gene Naming</h1>

<p>On rapid.ensembl.org we have assigned gene symbols, and thereby inferred function, through a machine learning approach.</p>

<p>The classifier has been trained on existing vertebrate gene symbol assignments in Ensembl. Some of these gene symbols have come from expert manual assignment (<a href="https://www.genenames.org/">HGNC</a>, VGNC, <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">MGI</a>, <a href="https://zfin.org/">Zfin</a> etc.), however most gene symbols have been assigned through orthology to human or another major reference through Ensembl gene trees.</p> 

<p>After training using these data, the classifier assigned symbols with about 94-97 percent accuracy. It is, however, important to note that the training data were slightly imperfect to begin with, so the classifier has replicated a very good, but imperfect system, with very high accuracy.</p>
